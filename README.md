# IQFit
This program can be used to generate lots of puzzles (and solutions) for the specific puzzle game called 'IQ Fit' by Smart Games.

# Usage
Compile the program in a IDE of choice (compatible with C#), such as Visual Studio. When running the application, the program will start to generate a puzzle, allowing you to solve it. Tapping any key on your keyboard (other than 'Esc') will show the solution to the current puzzle and allows the program to start generating a new puzzle. The program closes when you tap 'Esc'.

# Remark on display
This program outputs to a console, meaning that it cannot use colors. Instead the program identifies the different color pieces by using an integer between 0-9. These are determined using the order of the colors in the rainbow. More specifically, refer to the following table.

| ID | Color       |
| -- | ----------- |
| 0  | Red         |
| 1  | Orange      |
| 2  | Yellow      |
| 3  | Light Green |
| 4  | Dark Green  |
| 5  | Light Blue  |
| 6  | Blue        |
| 7  | Dark Blue   |
| 8  | Purple      |
